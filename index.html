<p>Basheerah Sabree</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Georgia. I’ve lived in several cities within the metro Atlanta area, so I guess you could say I am somewhat of a modern day nomad. 
I initially started as a Psychology/Pre-Med student and somewhere down the line, I was introduced to <span style="color:red">Computer Science</span> and never turned back.
<p>I have approximately 50 brothers and sisters. No, my mother and father did not have 50 children. I have one actual blood related younger brother. The other 49 consist of a Co-Ed Business Fraternity called <a href="http://www.akpsigsu.com/" target="_blank">Alpha Kappa Psi</a> that I have been a member of since my freshman year.
I grew up playing sports and I was very involved in different types of performing arts(voice, theater, dance etc.). Fun fact: I performed a dance and cheerleading routine on TV when I was 10-years-old; I throughly enjoyed my 5 minutes of fame. 
I also had the chance to sing the national anthem once at a Braves game when I was 14. Unfortunately, it was not a solo, but singing with a group is a great way to calm your nerves. One accomplishment that I am most proud of was organizing and running a charity event with an audience of 600+ people. My team and I raised $3000 towards our cause.
</p> 
<p>I have a naturally <span style="color:red">adventurous</span> spirit. I’ve been <a href="http://www.southeasternexpeditions.com/rafting/" target="_blank"> white water rafting</a>, which if you haven’t done it you should try it!
 Next on the list is sky diving and I’m still debating bungee jumping. 
 I’ve traveled to Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Next trips will be Chicago, California, the Bahamas, and <a href="http://www.visitcostarica.com/ict/paginas/home.asp?ididioma=2" target="_blank">Costa Rica</a>.
 I am as nice as I look and I believe in treating others the way you wish to be treated. 
 Life is ever-changing and my perspective on life is to always be grateful and <span style="color:red">fully</span> embrace every life experience.
